# RicardianContract
Made for course D0020E at LTU

This project connects the node database neo4j through a Policy Machine system
with a {link} negotiation engine to create a frontend for sharing data.

<h1>Getting started.</h1>

<h3>Docker</h3>
First of all we need to launch some kind of server with the policy machine. For this purpouse we have used Docker together with a tomcat server and neo4j.
For instructions on setting up the Docker we reffer to the Policy Machine github: https://github.com/PM-Master/Policy-Machine.

<h3>MongoDB</h3>
We also need to have a server for handeling datasets, contracts and login information. Here we use MongoDB hosted on https://cloud.mongodb.com/. For instructions on how to setup the MongoDB we reffer to https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/.
