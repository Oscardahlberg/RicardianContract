# RicardianContract
Made for course D0020E at LTU

This project connects the node database neo4j through a NGAC system
with a {link} negotiation engine to create a frontend for sharing data.

We have a docker container that holds the neo4j and tomcat server.
For storing data that will be shared we have used Mongodb.
